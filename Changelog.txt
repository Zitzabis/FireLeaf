**Notes**
Now, I know some of the sources for the textures could be found else where in the game, but this is just where I first noticed it and chose to extract it. There may also be variations of the same texture. If you can tell me about a location where it's better, I'll take a look.

Anyway, as follows is a full list of where the textures were sourced and what was done with them.
When I say "with liberty" I mean I had to sort of invent the texture based on the real deal. For example, there are no clear log textures (unless you want a tri-coloured log). So I had to invent a texture to go on it.
A mashup means that I combined textures to create one that will work in Minecraft.
If I made an adjustment, I had the basics of the texture copied over but in the porting process, I had to change the texture a bit to make it practical. For example, the wooden door. Originaly, it didn't have a window.

While I say I sourced some of these textures, that doesn't mean they are 100% rips. Instead, there was a lot of colours and component ripping, but with a lot of formatting having to be done to make the texture work in Minecraft.

There are also a lot of custom textures. I'm sorry, it couldn't be helped.

**Mobs**
All the mobs are based on Pokemon found in Fire Red and Leaf Green. Pokemon past that point are not included. For the cows, if you comment saying "Oh you should have done a Miltank!" I'll pull out a standard "That's not how this texture pack works." response. I know there are better Pokemon I could use, but I stuck with those found in Fire Red/Leaf Green. Also, all the colours used and styles are taken from the in-game sprites. No external pictures used. So excuse any poor details. I have no idea what the Tauros' butt looks like and there is nothing I can do about it.
