1. Introduction

################################################################################

1.1. Welcome

Fire Leaf is a texture/resource pack designed for both Minecraft and Pokemon fans 
alike. It remains true to the feeling of the Fire Red and Leaf Green Pokemon 
games that were released on the Gameboy. This was undoubtable one of the best 
generations of the Pokemon series and by far one of the most remembered. 
This texture/resource pack plays right into that and brings back the classic 
nostalgia of Pokemon.

################################################################################

1.2. Overview


The goal was to create a texture/resource pack that carried the feel of the Fire 
Red/Leaf Green games while keeping the blocks recognizable within Minecraft. This 
allows the player to just start the game and know what they're digging, what 
they're cutting down and what they're holding. No interpretations of the blocks 
for the most part.


With the aid of playing through the game and taking screenshots and using sprites 
from in-game, the majority of the textures are as you would see them if you played 
the original game it's self. Other Pokemon texture/resource packs attempt to do 
this but unfortunately fall short of recreating that bright and cheerful world of 
Pokemon. Many of these texture/resource packs have a lot of custom textures that 
don't always fit in with the rest of the original textures. Or else, they recreate 
the original textures by hand. While this should be applauded, naturally there 
will be faults and differences. This texture/resource pack removes such faults 
and takes the textures directly from the game, handmade by the original development 
team.


While this texture pack may not tickle the fancy for all Pokemon lovers and some 
may feel that it doesn't quite live up to it's description, those who don't even 
care for Pokemon will still enjoy this texture pack. Many builds and projects can 
be done using this texture/resource pack as most of the textures blend with each 
other well and the majority of them have no Pokemon branding (exceptions include 
the cake, chiseled quartz block, Nether portal and a few other things). So even 
if you aren't a fan of Pokemon, this texture/resource pack will still be a great
experience.

2.1. How to Install


If you've never used a texture/resource pack, then welcome to your first one! 
Or if you're reading this just to read it, then welcome also!

I'll give a quick run down on installing this texture/resource pack from the 
Windows point of view.

=Steps=

1. Understand where the texture/resource pack is so you can find it again. Go ahead 
   and copy it to your clipboard by pressing Ctrl+C or Ctrl+X with the file selected. 
   Or right click on the ZIP file and choose "Copy" or "Cut". It should be in your 
   Downloads folder. If you can't find that, then may the Pokemon god help you!

2. Launch Minecraft if you haven't already and from the main menu, go to Options. 
   You should see the "Resource Packs..." button near the bottom. Click on this.

3. You will now see a listing of all your currently installed texture/resource 
   packs. You will then see a button saying "Open resource pack Folder". Click on this. 

4. A window will open. This is where all the texture/resource packs need to be. 
   Assuming you followed step one correctly, you can just press Ctrl+V or right click 
   and select "Paste". 

5. Close this window and go back to Minecraft and you should see the 
   texture/resource pack sitting in the pane to the left. It will have a picture 
   of a tree as it's icon. Hover over the texture/resource pack pack and you should
   see an arrow pointing to the right. 
   Click this arrow to send the texture/resource pack into the right pane. 

6. Click "Done" and back out of all the settings to get back to the game. 
   The texture/resource pack should be loaded by now.

2.2. Getting Help

Do you need help with the texture pack? Unsure of what a certain block is? 
Something not quite working correctly? Think you could do better? Well then

3.1. Credit

Naturally credit needs to be given. Now then, under the images used to extract 
textures of the game, there are a fair few people who want credit for ripping. 
I can't name you individually, however, I want to give a big thanks to the people 
over at Spriters Resource. You made my job a lot easier and helped to deliver the 
textures in the most original form possible. So many of you did a lot work in 
ripping the images and sprites that you quite simply should not be overlooked.

As for all the custom textures, they belong to myself, Zitzabis. If you want to 
use them for whatever reason, please message me and we'll work out a deal. But 
please do NOT just use them without my permission.

Of course this texture/resource pack wouldn't be possible without the very 
creation of the game. So a HUGE thanks to Gamefreak and Creatures Inc.! Their 
team created all of the orginal textures. They by far outrank myself and the 
people at Spriters Resource. For this reason, I devote the entire texture/resource 
to them. Naturally I keep the custom textures but I give the rest of the credit 
entirely to them. They did a great job and it was their art style that has heavily 
influenced and improved my own skills.

Please note that I very strictly give credit to Gamefreak and Creatures Inc. for 
the textures they own. I do not claim any of their textures as my own at any point 
in the documentation or in the presentation. If anything is ever brought up, I will 
continue to give the appropiate credit to Gamefreak and Creatures Inc. and I won't 
back off on this. As for any of you who question my rights to use these textures:

1. I am not claiming them as my own and I have giving clear credit to Gamefreak and 
   Creatures Inc.
2. I am not making any money or profits on textures.
3. These textures, in an even more rip like form, can be found on Spriters Resource 
   where they do not run into any legal issues. I don't know the details on this, but 
   considering the scale of their opperation and their willingness to remove textures 
   if there is a problem, things must be ok with Gamefreak and Creatures Inc., so in 
   turn, I'll just assume things are ok with me using the textures until I have been 
   contacted. If I am contacted by Gamefreak and/or Creatures Inc. and they want me 
   to remove their textures, I will quite willingly do so. I respect Gamefreak and 
   Creatures Inc. and what they do and I have no intention in causing them any grief.

So if you do have a problem with this texture pack existing, I'm sorry... You'll need to 
talk to someone else since I feel that I am in the right. As a note to the PMC 
mods and staff, should you wish to remove this texture pack from this site, I 
understand. But I would like to come to some sort of agreement before it is 
permanently deleted. There are still a lot of original textures of my own making 
and if need be, I can make original textures to replace the ones owned by 
Gamefreak and Creatures Inc.. But my preferance would be to keep the 
Gamefreak and Creatures Inc. owned textures as they maintain the most 
Fire Red/Leaf Green feel in the texture pack (obvious, I know...). Thanks!
